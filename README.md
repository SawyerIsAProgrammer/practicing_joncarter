 I learnt this tutorial: [Design a portfolio website using Bootstrap HTML and CSS / Bootstrap Landing Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e8p0R5-b5A&list=PLe11AclHJd6pniTwFENdeHxCLiDThOq_B&index=2&t=2724s)
 
 and then for practicing what I learnt I built this website on my own.
 all images are from the tutorial project.
